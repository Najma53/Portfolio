# Portfolio
As bootcamp user, need to build portfolio so as I progress forward can attach different projects.

## Description

This project required us to create portfolio with following criteria
* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Getting Started
Step 1

Created a new repository on my GitHub account and clone it to my computer.

Then I deployed it by using the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push my code to my GitHub repository.

I Navigated to my GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

On the Settings page, scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the main branch as my source.

This led to my webpage viral https://najma53.github.io/Portfolio

Step 2

Using the terminal opened VS Code
Started looking at index.html file and changing text and saving and opening in live browser to see what each changes does and how the webpage is progressing.
Along with index html file , CSS style was also looked at and different variable were changed at different times to see visual change on webpage.
Layout kept changing as css parameters were changed.
Fist thing that was buid was navbar using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg
Learned extra features like toggle hence added them. They are great features.
Then used same technique to uild footer.
Git add -A, Git commit -m" description of changes" and git push origin main command were used to link my changes from my laptop to my repository on github.
Main Body is a huge challenge. Went back to wiring ...

## Conclusion
A very challenging project which I thoroughly enjoyed and is still under construction.
